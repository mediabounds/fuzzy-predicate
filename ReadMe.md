Filter an array of objects (or an array of just about anything) down to only include those objects with properties _somewhat_ matching the provided query.

```js
var fuzzy = require("fuzzy-predicate");
	
var data = [
	{
		name: "Dan Smith"
	},
	{
		name: "Issac Long"
	}
];
	
var result = data.filter(fuzzy("dan"));
	
console.log(result);
// [{
// 		name: "Dan Smith"
// }]	

result = data.filter(fuzzy("dun", 0.2));
	
console.log(result);
// [{
// 		name: "Dan Smith"
// }]
```

Installation
------------
```
npm install fuzzy-predicate --save
```

Usage
------------

### 1. Import the library
```js	
var fuzzy = require("fuzzy-predicate");
```

### 2. Generate a predicate
```js
// where "apple" is the data you're looking for
var predicate = fuzzy("apple");
```

### 3. Use the predicate to filter an array
```js
var result = myArray.filter(predicate);
```

`result` now contains only the elements in `myArray` that _somewhat_ match the query ("apple").

`myArray` could have been an array of strings, an array of numbers, an array of objects, or even an array of arrays. `fuzzy-predicate` will recursively search through all the data trying to find something that matches the original query.

Example
------------
`fuzzy-predicate` is an ideal tool for using user input to filter a response from a Web service. Let's say you have an array of objects that each represent a user and you wanted to find user(s) named "John":

```js
var fuzzy = require("fuzzy-predicate");
	
var data = [
	{
		id: "7128792",
		name: "John Doe",
		mail: "jdoe@example.com",
		twitter: "john_doe"
	},
	{
		id: "1203922",
		name: "Jane Doe",
		mail: "jane.doe@example.com",
		twitter: "grannysmithapple"
	},
	{
		id: "9189701",
		name: "Dan Smith",
		mail: "dan.smith@example.com",
		twitter: "javascripz",
	}
];

var result = data.filter(fuzzy("john"));
```
	
In this scenario, `result` would be an array containing a single element:

```js
{
	id: "7128792",
	name: "John Doe",
	mail: "jdoe@example.com",
	twitter: "john_doe"
}
```

But what if the query was "smith"?

```js
var result = data.filter(fuzzy("smith"));
```

`result` would contain two elements:

```js
{
	id: "1203922",
	name: "Jane Doe",
	mail: "jane.doe@example.com",
	twitter: "grannysmithapple"
},
{
	id: "9189701",
	name: "Dan Smith",
	mail: "dan.smith@example.com",
	twitter: "javascripz",
}
```

When searching for "smith," `fuzzy-predicate` found a match in the Twitter handle for Jane, and the name (and email) property for Dan. 

Perhaps we only wanted to find people with a _name_ matching "Smith":

```js
var result = data.filter(fuzzy("smith", ["name"]));
```
	
This time, `result` would contain only one element:

```js
{
	id: "9189701",
	name: "Dan Smith",
	mail: "dan.smith@example.com",
	twitter: "javascripz",
}
```	


Documentation
------------

**fuzzy(query, keys, leven)**  
Returns a filter predicate (function) suitable for passing to [`Array.prototype.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).

* `query`: The filter query to use to reduce an array down to objects matching the query. This can be a string or a number.
* `keys`: Optionally restrict the search to a set of keys; only applied when filtering objects. This can be a string containing the name of a single key, or an array of keys.
* `threshold`: The [Dice's Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) threshold used to consider matches. This means that differences such as "In my camp Dan has a fire" and "Dun has fire" can be tolerated. It's a fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates the degree of similarity between the needle and haystack. 0 indicates completely different strings, 1 indicates identical strings.

### Normalization
What makes this a "fuzzy" filter is that it is looking for values that _somewhat_ match the queryâ€”not exact matches.

When comparing strings, the needle (the query) and the haystack value are both normalized following these rules:

1. Convert the string to a lowercase string
2. Remove all non-word characters (characters matching the `\W` regex and underscores)

Then, instead of checking string equality, it checks to see if the haystack value contains the needle value (using `indexOf`). If it does, it's considered a match. If threshold is supplied, then a [Dice's Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) algorithm is used to compare the degree of difference between the needle and haystack and if it's above or equal to the threshold then it's a match.

This process only applies when comparing strings; numbers must be exactly equal to be considered a match.

Contributing
------------
I welcome pull requests containing bug fixes and documentation improvements for `fuzzy-predicate`. Be sure to run the tests before submitting any changes.

And although I consider `fuzzy-predicate` to be _mostly_ feature complete, I welcome discussion on how it could be a more useful tool (e.g. if callers could customize how normalization worked).
